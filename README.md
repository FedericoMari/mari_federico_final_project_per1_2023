Fall2023_final_project:
The overview will screen-scrape a job application website and organizationally print out the companies, jobs, extra info, salary, and skills required to satisfy these specific jobs. My project will revolve around jobs for architectural jobs.

Description:
My final project will encompass a clear creation of all the jobs possible for a person looking into starting a career into architectural design. I will scrape the html data of the wesbite by inspecting each attribute and individual class storing the string information or website data. I will later display the organized list of possible jobs with their skills, extra information, and try to validate a user input by asking which company works best for him/her. The screen-scraper will also refresh after every 10 minutes and "re-scrape" the website since employers change their requirements almost on the daily.
